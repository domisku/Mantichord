# Mantichord (music tool to generate chord progressions)

Mantichord is a tool for musicians to generate and playback chord progressions.

Project was built with Scribbletune, Tone.js, Javascript, CSS and HTML.

I made this when I was starting out with coding, Mantichord was my first bigger project.
I suppose the code could be way cleaner, the algorithm for chord generation is rather plain and generates only diatonic chords.
Nevertheless, I think the resulting progressions sound pretty great if rather simplistic.
After all, there is much more to music than just the chords.

## Features

1. Generate diatonic chord progressions
2. Listen to progressions that you generated
3. Choose one of three sampled instruments (piano and two synthesizers)
4. Control tempo and volume with sliders
5. Change key signature
6. Add pregenerated drum patterns to listen along with the chords
7. Switch up rhythmic patterns for sampled instruments
8. Website works on mobile devices
